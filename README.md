# VigiLight
VigiLight is an Arduino-based security alert system designed to assist people with hearing loss. Using a passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor, it detects movement in the area and activates flashing LED lights to visually notify users of any presence nearby, enhancing safety and awareness in their environment.
