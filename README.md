An Arduino project for providing security alerts for people with hearing loss

---

### Project Description

The device detects motion in the vicinity and triggers flashing lights in the room to alert the presence of a person or animal in their compound.

---

### Components

- **Motion Sensor**    – Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensor
- **Micro Controller** – Arduino UNO 
- **Micro Processor**  – mega328p
- **Lights**           – LEDs
- **Power**            – 9V Battery


---

### Process

Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensor detects changes in infrared radiation emitted from objects like human beings and animals in their field of view. When a warm object moves in its field of view it detects a variation in infrared radiation (heat) that triggers a signal, which is used as an input for the micro processor to activate LED bulbs to blink.

### Other Applications

- This device is already in the market for switching on yard lights in the houses and industrial yards.
- This device can be customized and modified to emit powerful light to scare wild animals in the areas where man-animal conflict exists or in the farms to scare rodents.
